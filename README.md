## What is L0p4Map? 👁️

L0p4Map is a professional-grade network monitoring tool that combines the power of nmap with a clean, modern dark UI. Designed for security researchers and network administrators who need fast, detailed visibility into their infrastructure.

No bloat. No BS. Just raw network intelligence.

---

## Features

- **ARP Network Scan** — fast host discovery with local IEEE OUI database lookup
- **Hostname Resolution** — multi-method detection via reverse DNS, NetBIOS (Windows devices) and mDNS/Avahi (Linux, Mac, IoT)
- **Full nmap Integration** — SYN scan, UDP, OS detection, service version, NSE scripts
- **Banner Grabbing** — HTTP, SMB, FTP, SSH, SSL enumeration
- **Vulnerability Detection** — CVE lookup via vulners, vuln scripts, malware detection
- **Traceroute** — ICMP-based with real-time output
- **Dark Professional UI** — built with PyQt6, designed for researchers
- **Network Graph** — interactive topology visualization via vis.js
- **Interface Selection** — choose which network interface to scan on
- **Scan Export** — save full nmap output to `.txt` via native file manager dialog
- **Graph Export** — export the network topology as CSV or PNG
- **Live Monitoring** — auto-refresh the network graph at configurable intervals (30s / 60s / 120s)
- **Attack Surface section** — visualize exposed services, open ports, and potential vulnerabilities on hosts, helping identify security risks at a glance. (*in development*)
- **Traffic Analyzer page** — real-time network traffic inspection and analysis (*In Development*)
- **Custom Node Labels** — assign custom names to devices directly from the graph
- **Attack surface Result Download** — save full output to `.csv` via native file manager dialog *(`.pdf` soon!)*

## 🚧 Upcoming Features

- **CVE Links opening** — fix opening of CVE links
- **Graph Persistence** — save and reload network topologies

## Requirements

- Linux (Debian or Arch)
- Python 3.11+
- nmap installed (`sudo pacman -S nmap` or `sudo apt install nmap`)
- Root privileges (required for ARP scanning)

---

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HaxL0p4/L0p4Map.git
cd L0p4Map
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo chmod +x L0p4Map.sh
```

---

## Usage

Launch the tool with root privileges:
```bash
sudo ./L0p4Map.sh
```

1. Select the network interface from the toolbar dropdown
2. Press **[ SCAN ]** to discover all devices on your network
3. Click a device to see details and run quick actions (ping, traceroute)
4. Press **[ PORT SCAN ]** to open the full nmap scan interface
5. Select scan options and press **[ RUN SCAN ]** — export results with **[ EXPORT SCAN ]**
6. Switch to the graph view to explore the network topology — export as CSV or PNG
7. Enable **[ LIVE ]** to keep the graph updated automatically

## Legal Disclaimer

This tool is designed for **authorized network auditing only**. Only use L0p4Map on networks you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning is illegal.
